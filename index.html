        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML is used to give a website's content structure.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of the elements that work together to provide structure</li>
          <li>HTML elements ARE case-sensitive. Declarations are NOT case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>Two important elements when using HTML are: the head element and the body element</li>
          <li> Some of the elements are visibile to the user while others are not</li>
          <li>Element types often used to add content to pages: Text, Image, Header, and List</li>
          <li>Element types often used to divide and describe a page: Meta-related, Content division, and Semantic</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>   
          <li> The information that the head element contains is called metadata</li>
          <li>The head element's metadata/information assists the browser to render the page correctly</li>
          <li>Elements within the head are NOT visible to the user</li>
          <li>The title tag goes inside the head element</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>IMPORTANT: HTML attributes are ALWAYS defined in the beginning element, NEVER the closing element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS means Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline, internal style sheet, and external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Use inline CSS  to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The Box Model refers to the idea that HTML elements are esstemtially boxes that nest inside each other.</li>
          <li>A HTML element box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
