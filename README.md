# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

My motivation in creating the Prework Study Guide was was to create a reference for the concepts that were explained in the modules and the supplemental reading.
I built the Prework Study Guide as a practical application for the concepts I was being introduced to. I wanted to become for familliar and comfortable with HTML CSS JavaScript Git GitHub Gitbash.
This Prework Study Guide now acts as a referance for the concepts that I marked down as significant and noteworthy while providing a jumping off point to continue adding to as my knowledge expands. If it helps anyone else move faster through the process than I did then I am pleased.
I learned about the affore mention concepts (HTML CSS JavaScript Git GitHub Gitbash) as I followed the modules to put together this Prework Study Guide. I leanred the basics regarding: Growth Mindset, Computational Thinking, Agile Software Environments, the Command Line SSH Keys Version Control and Markdown. I learned about the community and the many varied resources avaible for people at all levels of coding expertise and knowledge.

If the user opens up the DevTools console they will be able to see the Javascript running. The console will display the topics learned over the course the prework and the main page is the culmination of the concepts introduced and expanded on during the prework.
